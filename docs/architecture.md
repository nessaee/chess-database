# Chess Database System Architecture

## Overview
The chess database system is a full-stack application built with modern technologies, featuring a React-based frontend and Python backend with asynchronous operations. This document outlines the core architectural components and their interactions.

## System Components

### Frontend Layer
- **Framework**: React with Vite
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive Chess Game Viewer

### Backend Architecture

#### 1. Repository Layer
The repository layer implements the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern, organizing business logic into distinct domains:

##### Domain Repositories
- **Game Repository**
  - Game CRUD operations
  - Move history management
  - Game state tracking
  - Position indexing

- **Player Repository**
  - Player profile management
  - Rating history
  - Performance statistics
  - Game history tracking

- **Analysis Repository**
  - Position analysis
  - Engine evaluation storage
  - Analysis caching
  - Batch analysis management

- **Opening Repository**
  - Opening tree management
  - ECO classification
  - Position statistics
  - Common variations

##### Common Components
- Shared utilities
- Error handling
- Validation logic
- Data transformations

#### 2. Data Models
Implements a rich domain model pattern with the following key entities:

##### Core Models
- **Game**
  - Game metadata
  - Move sequences
  - Player references
  - Time control
  - Opening classification

- **Player**
  - Profile information
  - Rating history
  - Performance metrics
  - Game statistics

- **Analysis**
  - Position evaluations
  - Engine analysis
  - Best move sequences
  - Position statistics

- **Opening**
  - ECO classifications
  - Move sequences
  - Theoretical evaluations
  - Historical statistics

##### Supporting Models
- **Endpoint**: API usage tracking
- **Request**: Request logging
- **Base**: Shared model functionality

#### 3. Database Layer
- **Engine**: PostgreSQL with AsyncPG driver
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async support
- **Connection Management**:
  - Asynchronous connection pool
  - Health check enabled
  - Connection recycling (1-hour interval)
  - Development mode: Connection pooling disabled

#### 4. API Layer
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Features**:
  - OpenAPI documentation
  - Automatic schema validation
  - Dependency injection
  - Async request handling

##### API Structure
1. Game Operations
   - Game creation and retrieval
   - Move validation
   - Game state management
   - Analysis integration

2. Player Operations
   - Profile management
   - Rating calculations
   - Statistics aggregation
   - History tracking

3. Analysis Operations
   - Position evaluation
   - Engine integration
   - Batch analysis
   - Cache management

4. Database Operations
   - Health monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Maintenance tasks

### Middleware Stack
1. Performance Monitoring
   - Request timing
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Performance metrics collection

2. Metrics Collection
   - Request counts
   - Error rates
   - Response times
   - Database operation metrics

3. CORS Handler
   - Configurable origins

   - Header management

## System Integration

### Frontend-Backend Communication
1. RESTful API Integration
   - Standardized endpoints
   - JSON data exchange
   - Error handling protocols
   - Rate limiting

2. Real-time Features
   - Analysis updates
   - Game state synchronization
   - Player status updates

3. Data Flow
   - Asynchronous loading
   - Pagination handling
   - Cache management
   - Error recovery

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
1. Error Handling
   - Global error boundaries
   - Domain-specific error types
   - Error logging and monitoring
   - Recovery strategies

2. Performance Optimization
   - Database query optimization
   - Frontend bundle optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Load balancing

3. Security Measures
   - Input validation
   - Request sanitization
   - Authentication
   - Authorization

## Security Architecture
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure credential management
- Request validation
- CORS protection
- Frontend input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Deployment Architecture
- Docker containerization for both frontend and backend
