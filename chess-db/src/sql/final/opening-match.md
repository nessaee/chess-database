Efficient Opening Matching:
Uses the encoded moves format where first two bytes contain length
Orders openings by length (descending) to ensure most specific match
Uses substring comparison for efficient matching
Matches each game with exactly one opening (the longest matching one)
Performance Optimizations:
Creates a materialized view for fast querying
Adds indexes on frequently queried columns (eco, white_id, black_id, date)
Uses CROSS JOIN LATERAL for efficient matching
Pre-calculates white_score for easier statistics
Automatic Updates:
Creates a refresh function that can be run concurrently
Adds triggers to automatically refresh when games or openings change
Uses statement-level triggers to avoid excessive refreshes
Example Queries:
Includes commented example queries for:
Getting opening statistics for a specific player
Finding most popular openings overall
To use this view:

Run the script to create the view and supporting functions
The view will automatically update when games or openings change
Query the view using the example queries as templates
The view includes these columns:

game_id: Reference to original game
white_id/black_id: Player IDs
result/date_played/time_control/rated: Game metadata
eco/opening_name: Opening information
move_length: Length of the matching opening
white_score: Pre-calculated score (1 for white win, 0 for black win, 0.5 for draw)

How can this query be further optimized?

I'll optimize the query further with several performance improvements:

Here are the key optimizations I've made to improve query performance:

Preprocessed Openings Table:
Created a dedicated table for preprocessed openings
Pre-calculates move lengths and prefixes
Uses fillfactor=100 for read optimization
Added specialized indexes for prefix matching
Improved Indexing Strategy:
Added partial covering index for rated games
Used hash index for player lookups
Used BRIN index for date ranges (more efficient for sequential data)
Added compound indexes for common query patterns
Better Data Locality:
Added clustering on the player covering index
Helps with range scans and player-specific queries
Maintains physical ordering of related data
Query Optimization:
Used DISTINCT ON for efficient longest match selection
Replaced CROSS JOIN LATERAL with regular JOIN
Added WHERE clause to filter invalid matches early
Pre-computed game lengths for faster comparison
Statistics and Analysis:
Added multi-column statistics for better query planning
Included ANALYZE statements after updates
Created specialized functions for common queries
Optimized Functions:
Added get_player_opening_stats for player analysis
Added get_popular_openings with flexible parameters
Both functions use optimized indexes and include common filters
Improved Refresh Strategy:
Updates preprocessed data first
Uses concurrent refresh for better availability
Updates statistics after refresh
Handles both openings and games updates efficiently
These optimizations should significantly improve:

Initial matching performance
Query response time
Data locality
Concurrent access
Memory usage
Query plan quality
